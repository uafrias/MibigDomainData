#' eSnaPD: a package to obtain DNA sequences of PFAM domains found in Mibig
#'
#' This package is the core analysis package for the environmental Surveyor of Natural Product Diversity, a method for assessing natural product
#' diversity using sequenced amplicons. The package includes nucleotide sequences for conserved domains derived from the Mibig Dataset
#' \url{http://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/}, and is used to define blast databases for the classifaciotnof clusters obtained from
#'sequence amplicons.
#'
#' The build scripts to obtain the mibig data can be found in the data-raw directory.
